# üçï Pizza Review QA Bot

This project is a Question-Answering (QA) bot designed to answer questions about a pizza restaurant using realistic customer reviews. It uses [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), and [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) to provide contextual answers from a vector database built from real review data.

---

## üìå About

This bot performs the following:

- Embeds restaurant reviews using `mxbai-embed-large`
- Stores them in a Chroma vector database
- Uses `llama3.2` via Ollama for local question answering
- Retrieves the top 5 relevant reviews to inform each answer

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. The app reads review data from a CSV file.
2. It generates embeddings using Ollama.
3. It stores them using Chroma DB.
4. It runs a command-line chatbot that:
   - Takes a question
   - Retrieves the top matching reviews
   - Answers with the help of a local LLM (Llama3.2)

---

## üß™ Example Questions

- "Is the pizza crust crispy?"
- "What do people say about the prices?"
- "How is the service at this restaurant?"
